Ayla (Beta 2) by SilentProtagonist 
--------------------------------

Release Date: December 11th, 2012.

Ayla is a three-button character made for MUGEN 1.0.
This is a beta version: in other words, it's not completely finished.

What's missing:

- More palettes
- Special intros/winposes, maybe.

Ayla's Moveset

--------------
Throws
--------------

*Boulder Toss
	Command: F/B + [a+b/b+c/a+c] (Standing)
	A standard throw. The direction you press determines the
	direction your opponent will be thrown.


*Cat Attack
	Command: D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing)
	A special throw where Ayla jumps at the opponent,
	scratching and biting him/her if it connects.
	This attack only hits in the falling part of the jump.
	This attack can be cancelled into Drill Kick (see below).

--------------
Specials
--------------

*Rock Throw
	Command: D, DF, F + a/b/c (Standing)
	A standard projectile that travels in an arc.
	The speed and range of the rock depend on the button pressed.

*Backflip Kick 
	F, D, DF + a/b/c (Standing)
	Ayla does a rising kick and a diagonal kick after it.
	The speed and angle of the attack depend on the button pressed.
	You can cancel the first part of this special into its second
	part by pressing a/b/c.

*Drill Kick
	a/b/c (while executing Cat Attack)
	Ayla throws herself horizontally at the opponent while spinning.


*Tail Whirl
	Command: D, DB, B + a/b/c Air)
	Ayla does a Tatsumaki Senpuu Kyaku-styled series of kicks while
	advancing in the air.

Supers
------

*Tail Spin
	Command: D, DB, B, D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing)
	Requires 1000 Power.
	Ayla spins and creates two twisters that damage the opponent.
	You can press forward or backwards during the spinning to slowly
	move and rack up more damage.
	
*Triple Kick
	Command: D, DF, F, D, DF, F, a/b/c (Standing)
	Requires 1000 Power.
	Ayla jumps at the opponent, kicking him/her/it up to three times.
	If the first kick  misses or is blocked, the move fails, so
	try to use this as a combo finisher.

*Gatling Kick
	Command: ~D, B, D, F + a/b/c (Standing)
	Requires 1000 Power. 
	Ayla jumps forwards, making a spinning kick. If it connects, 
	the enemy will be trapped in a vortex of debris. This is a throw 
	move, so don't try it against enemies immune to those.
