Lucca by SilentProtagonist 
--------------------------------

Lucca is a three-button character made for MUGEN 1.0.

What's missing:

- Pretty much everything

Supers

*Tail Spin
	Command: D, DB, B, D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing)
	Requires 1000 Power.
	Ayla spins and creates two twisters that damage the opponent.
	You can press forward or backwards during the spinning to slowly
	move and rack up more damage.
	
*Triple Kick
	Command: D, DF, F, D, DF, F, a/b/c (Standing)
	Requires 1000 Power.
	Ayla jumps at the opponent, kicking him/her/it up to three times.
	If the first kick  misses or is blocked, the move fails, so
	try to use this as a combo finisher.

*Gatling Kick
	Command: ~D, B, D, F + a/b/c (Standing)
	Requires 1000 Power. 
	Ayla jumps forwards, making a spinning kick. If it connects, 
	the enemy will be trapped in a vortex of debris. This is a throw 
	move, so don't try it against enemies immune to those.
