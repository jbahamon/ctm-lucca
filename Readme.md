Lucca by SilentProtagonist 
=========================

Lucca is a three-button character made for MUGEN 1.0.
This is not a final version.

What's missing:

- Proper sounds
- More specials ..?
- More palettes
- Another intro 
- Special intros/winposes, maybe.


Lucca's Moveset
==============

Throws
--------------

**Hypnowave**: D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing). Requires 500 Power.

Lucca uses her Hypnowave to make a single opponent fall asleep. 
Obviously, the opponent has to be within range of the attack.
This attack actually doesn't do any damage, but if it hits, your 
opponent will be vulnerable for a bit of time (or until it gets hit).
Use this to your advantage!


Specials
--------------

**Napalm**: D, DF, F + a/b/c (Standing).

A standard projectile thrown in an arc. It explodes by hitting 
either your opponent or the ground. Both the grenade and the explosion
deal damage. The speed and angle depend on the button pressed. 

**Fire Uppercut**: F, D, DF + a/b/c (Standing).

Lucca rises vertically, wrapped up in flames. The button pressed 
determines the vertical distance you'll travel. Keep in mind that this 
attack won't give you any horizontal speed, but it gives you the chance 
to juggle your opponent, as you'll fall before him/her.


Supers
------

**Gato!**: D, DB, B, D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing). Requires 1000 Power.

Lucca summons Gato. He's had some practice, as he'll walk toward your 
opponent and try to punch him/her. You're free to move after Gato starts moving,
so try to team up with him! Gato will dissapear after a set time, 
so don't do this if your opponent is far away.
	
**Flare**: D, DF, F, D, DF, F, a/b/c (Standing). Requires 1000 Power.

Lucca executes the strongest Fire magic move. The flare will slowly advance
toward your opponent for a bit before dissapearing, and you can make it 
move up or down by pressing U or D.

**Time Egg **: D, B, D, F + a/b/c (Standing) Requires 1000 Power. 

Lucca shows her work with Time Eggs by using one against your opponent.
This attack has a very short range, but if it connects, your opponent 
will be thrown into Lavos' pocket dimension.
This is a throw, so keep in mind it won't work against unthrowable enemies 
(bosses are an example).

Special Mode
------------

**Protect**: a + c (Standing). Requires 3000 Power.

Lucca gets improved defenses. You'll receive less damage, and it actually won't 
make you flinch, so you can go on the offensive without worrying about getting hurt.
Your Power will automatically decrease: when you run out of Power, the mode ends.

Final Move
----------

**Gate Key Summon**: D, B, D, F + a/b/c (Standing, must have Berserker activated). Uses all of your Power.

Lucca uses her Gate Key to summon the Black Tyranno! It will appear over the closest 
opponent and bite down. Make sure it hits, 'cause you only have one shot.
