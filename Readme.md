Lucca is a three-button character (a+b+c keys) made for MUGEN 1.0.
This is not a final version but it should be playable.

What's missing:

- Possibly remaking Fire Uppercut.
- Specific character interactions (intros, winposes, double techs, maybe)

## Moveset

Lucca isn't very agile nor fast. Her game revolves around summoning
robots and throwing projectiles to put some pressure on your opponent.

### Special Moves

- **Hypnowave**: `D, DB, B, a/b/c` (Ground)

Requires 500 Power. Lucca uses her Hypnowave tech to put a single opponent 
whithin the attack's range to sleep. Doesn't deal any damage, but if it hits, the
opponent will be vulnerable for a while. Qualifies as a throw.

- **Napalm**: `D, DF, F, a/b/c` (Ground/air)

A projectile thrown in an arc. It explodes when it hits 
either an opponent or the ground. Both the grenade and the explosion
deal damage. The speed and angle depend on the button pressed. 

- **Fire Uppercut**: `F, D, DF, a/b/c` (Ground)

Lucca advances a bit, throwing a fiery uppercut.

- **Robot Call**: `D, DB, B, a/b/c` (Ground)

Lucca brings out a remote control, calling for help. 

The button pressed determines the summoned robot:

Pressing `a` calls a Bit that will float on front of Lucca and will shoot a 
single tracking missile when an enemy gets too close.

Pressing `b` calls a Debuggest that will stand in front of Lucca and shock any enemy 
that gets too close.

Pressing `c` calls a Proto-4 that will fire a missile when the opponent approaches.

You can have up to 3 summoned robots at a time.


### Super Moves

- **Gato/Gonzales**: `D, DB, B, D, DB, B, a/b/c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. Lucca summons Gato, the training robot. He will advance towards 
the opponent and try to punch them, stopping after a little while. Lucca is free 
to move after Gato is summoned.
	
- **Flare**: `D, DF, F, D, DF, F, a/b/c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. Lucca executes the strongest Fire magic move. 
You can control the Flare's movement for a while.

- **Gate Trap**: `D, B, D, F, a/b/c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. Lucca uses her Gate Key to open a Gate on the floor, 
which stays there for a while. If the opponent stands on it, they will fall 
through the gate and get damaged before returning to the battlefield. 
Qualifies as a throw.

### Special Mode

- **Protect**: `a + c` (Ground)

Requires 3000 Power. Lucca casts Protect on herself, improving her defenses. 
She gains super armor while in this state, and incoming damage is reduced. Lucca's Power 
will deplete continuously: when she runs out of Power, the mode ends.

### Final Move

- **Gate Key Summon**: `D, B, D, F, a/b/c` (Ground while Protect is active)

Spends all remaining Power. Lucca uses her Gate Key to summon the Black Tyranno. 
It will appear over the closest opponent and bite down. Qualifies as a throw.

## 12p Mode

Lucca's 12p mode is based on Bayonetta! During the intro you can choose whether you want a moveset based on Bayonetta 1 or 2. Their basic moveset is the same at the moment, but their supermoves are different. The basics are as follows:

- You use `a` for dodging: if you dodge at the right time, you gain some Power. You can dodge forwards or backwards, and in the air. Pressing forward and dodging twice in quick succession performs Panther Within for a quick approach.
- `b` and `c` are Punch and Kick, respectively. Chain these in various orders and you will perform the various combos from the Bayonetta games. Most combos end with a Wicked Weave: a summoned punch or kick for an extra oomph.

### 12p Special Moves

- **Torture Attack**: `D, DB, B, b/c` (Ground/Air)

Requires 500 Power. A short-ranged throw. Depending on the opponent's size, a different torture device or Infernal Demon will be used to inflict damage on them.

- **Tetsuzanko**: `B, F, b` (Ground/Air)

A forward slam attack. If you have 500 Power or more, 500 will be consumed to summon a Wicked Punch.

- **Heel Stomp**: `B, F, c` (Ground/Air)

A short-ranged stomp. If you have 500 Power or more, 500 will be consumed to summon a Wicked Stomp.

- **Stiletto**: `F, F, b` (Ground/Air)

An punching attack that closes distance while attacking.

- **Heel Slide**: `F, F, c` (Ground/Air)

A sliding attack that closes distance while attacking. If you hold `c` while it connects, it will attempt to launch the opponent into the air.

- **Witch Twist**: `b` (While dodging)

A rising attack that launches the enemies into the air along with her.

- **Heel Tornado**: `c` (While dodging)

An attack that stays in the ground and offers some movement while performed.

- **Witch Strike**: `b` (Right after jumping)

A multi-hitting uppercut

- **After Burner Kick**: `c` (Right after jumping) or `F + c` (Air)

An either ascending or descending air kick.

### 12p Super Moves

- **Bat Within**: `D, DB, B, D, DB, B, b/c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. Bayonetta strikes a pose. If hit while in this state, she will dodge the attack and time will slow down for everyone but her for a while.

- **Infernal Demon Summon**: `D, DF, F, D, DF, F, b/c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. Bayonetta performs a chant, using her hair as the summoning medium for an Infernal Demon. The specific demon depends on the button used and whether you're using the Bayonetta 1 or 2 moveset:

  * Punch + Bayonetta 1 summons Phantasmaraneae, the Twister of Flame: a fire spider that swipes twice with its claws.
  * Kick + Bayonetta 1 summons Malphas: a demonic bird that will pause before charging forward.
  * Punch + Bayonetta 2 summons Diomedes, Severer of the Dark: an infernal unicorn that will trample the opponent.
  * Kick + Bayonetta 2 summons Labolas, Destroyer of Fates: a hellhound that will jump twice on the opponent.

- **Climax Summon**: `D, DB, B, D, DF, F, b/c` (Ground)

Requires 2000 Power. Bayonetta performs a chant, using her hair for a final summon. Qualifies as a throw. The summoned demon depends on whether you're using the Bayonetta 1 or 2 moveset:

  * Bayonetta 1 summons Gomorrah, Devourer of the Divine. It will bite down on the opponent.
  * Bayonetta 2 summons Baal, Empress of the Fathoms. It will attempt to grab the opponent with its tongue.

Regardless of the summoned demon, tapping the button indicated in the prompt will increase the move's damage.
